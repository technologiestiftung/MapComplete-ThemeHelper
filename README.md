(I will keep the Repo active to host the custom icons that the water well status theme uses.)

## Goals

a. ~~Make it easier to develop Themes for MapComplete.~~

b. ~~Host Themes by the OSM Berlin Community that are not relevant for the broader MapComplete Userbase. But provide a nice sharabale Link for those Themes. We use Github Pages for that.~~

## ThemeHelper

[See `./ThemeHelper`](./ThemeHelper) for how to use the theme helper.

## OSM Berlin Themes

Custom themes are at [`./OSM-Berlin-Themes`](./OSM-Berlin-Themes) for a list of themes. They have their own readme files.
